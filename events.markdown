<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.5em;">Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble. Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.</span>

### Special events for the week of Aug 24

**Monday through Thursday - drop in anytime between 7:30 PM – 8:30 PM**  
**Democrat Response Party - When They Go Low, We Go Fight**  

Now that you heard from Michelle, Barack, Kamala, and Joe, let’s go and change history with our actions. While the Republicans hold their convention to lie, scare, distract, and divide, let’s take action (any amount is good) and show them that when they go low, we go fight. 

Please drop in anytime to our Democrat Response zoom party to check in and
share with us your actions, your thoughts and ideas on how we can win in
November.  

Feel free to share with us possible actions you have taken or would like to take:
* who you donated to
* what postcards you wrote
* who you phonebanked or texted for
* which protest you attended
* what signs you painted
* who you reached out to
* what social media you posted
* which elected official you contacted
* what information you want to know

We will also share DNC counterprogramming that will occur next week.
