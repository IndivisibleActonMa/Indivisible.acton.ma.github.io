The group communications channels are still evolving. Right now we have: 
* A closed Facebook Group to which people post events and news. It contains some photo albums of events. http://www.facebook.com/groups/indivisibleacton 
* A mailchimp email list to which a bulletin is sent every two weeks or so 
* A google group to which event organizers send out event announcements: mailto:indivisibleacton@gmail.com 
* A website, which contains event announcements, past event reports and general information. http://www.indivisibleacton.org
