Dear team,

Today is a tough day for the resistance. There’s no reason to sugar coat it. This was a long fight, and we here on the Text Team sustained days, weeks and months of tax scam work fighting back with everything we had. We grinded it out until the very end. The horrible effects of this bill will not be fully felt for months and years to come. And we know that those we care about most, those who depend on our institutions to provide a fair shot at the American dream will be hurt the most. It's truly a sad day for our country.

Despite the disappointing results of the tax scam vote, we as a team have a lot to be proud of and build off of as we head into 2018: the year we take back power and neutralize Trump.

All year, we’ve confronted a regime with full control of Congress and the White House. But our steadfast resistance over these months have helped stop some of the worst of what we all expected would come our way under Trump.

Since joining you all in June, I’ve been honored to work alongside you all as our team helped stop the complete dismantling of the Affordable Care Act.

Not once. Not twice. But THREE TIMES. 

For those of you here for each campaign, remember those long days over the summer, when we were 2 months into the struggle? I’ll never forget that 2am (or was it 3am?) victory moment with you all on Slack. What a night.

And just recently, when we helped build a wave of blue victories in Virginia, then a stunning win in the Alabama Senate race. ALABAMA! Who’d have ever thought that was possible?

The tax scam votes last night and re-vote today may very well have sealed the electoral fate of the GOP in 2018, and we here on the Text Team will do everything in power to ensure it does. 

We have a bold texting agenda for 2018 centered around three main priorities:

1. Resistance: Sustained banner campaigns opposing the Trump/GOP policy agenda, including "Defend Medicare" & "Repeal the cuts for the rich" campaigns, as well as continuing to defend frontline communities. 
2. Elections: Winning 75+ House races and at least 3 Senate races, as well as other down ballot races.
3. Building power: "Text every Dem" style campaign texting registered Dems across the country to activate these progressives for 2018 by growing our texting list.

We’ve built an amazing crew here, team. And we’re only getting bigger and stronger. Each day, I am rejuvenated and grateful for your insights, your passion and your dedication. I have complete confidence in the team we’ve built, and I know we will not be deterred by momentary victories for Trump and the GOP.

Over the 12/22-12/27 break, I hope you all get some time to recharge with some much needed self care and can come back on 12/28 or shortly afterwards ready to begin our march to a landslide victory in 2018.

Today we will wrap up our Dream Act accountability work starting at 11am ET. I may also have a post-tax bill accountability project for us. Details on this soon. Should we finish today, we'll head into our break tomorrow (12/21) instead of Friday.

A progressive wave is forming, mighty Text Team. Thank you all again for all you do for the movement.

Onwards! :fist:
