Indivisible Acton Area Members and friends attended the Special Committee of the House to Examine the Returns of Votes for Certain Representative Districts in support of #democracy. It was nice to also have the chance to touch base with new Reps [Simon Cataldo (14th Middlesex)](https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/S_C1){:target="_blank"} and [Kate Donaghue (19th Worcester)](https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/K_D1){:target="_blank"}
