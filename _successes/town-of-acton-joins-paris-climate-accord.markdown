Upon a joint petition from Indivisible Acton, the Activist Alliance and Mothers Out Front, the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Acton unanimously voted on Monday 7/10 to join [http://Climate-Mayors.org](http://climate-mayors.org) and [http://wearestillin.com](http://wearestillin.com) thereby openly declaring to the country that Acton is committed to achieving the goals set out by the Accord even if the president will not. It joins hundreds of cities around the country and many from Massachusetts in making this strong claim. 

State Representative Jen Benson, a local champion for climate initiatives such as Carbon Pricing testified stating that a declaration of this "makes a difference .. in the state and nationally".

The Acton Beacon featured this action three times in as many weeks:  [http://acton.wickedlocal.com/news/20170711/acton-selectmen-pledge-of-support-of-paris-climate-control](http://acton.wickedlocal.com/news/20170711/acton-selectmen-pledge-of-support-of-paris-climate-control)
