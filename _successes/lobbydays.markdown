Today, on the Ides of Trump, 13 delighted members of Indivisible Acton mailed 333 post cards to our 45th President asking him to lead this country with wisdom and telling him that we will fiercely resist his extreme and divisive agenda.

Many cards were addressed to President Bannon, which may have helped his removal from the NSA Principals Committee. Estimates are that a million cards were sent.
