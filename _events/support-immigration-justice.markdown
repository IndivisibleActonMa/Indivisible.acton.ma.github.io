***Note***

Families belong together in their communities. But Trump’s @DHSgov just rigged the rules against immigrants—forcing families to choose between health care, food & homes and a safe, stable future in the U.S.  Get more information on how we can help protect immigrant familes [HERE](www.protectingimmigrantfamilies.org). #ProtectFamilies

Here are other ways we can help immigrants and asylum seekers:

* Every month our local [Justice For Our Neighbors (JFON)](http://www.newenglandjfon.org) group provides free legal clinics for our neighbors struggling with the immigration process. Funds raised go toward hiring lawyers to staff these clinics. Acton Indivisible has assisted with these clinics by providing food and hospitality. To volunteer at a clinic, click [HERE](http://www.newenglandjfon.org/advocacy).  Contributions can be sent to: *New England Justice For Our Neighbors, Belmont-Watertown United Methodist Church, 421 Common St, Belmont MA 02478*. 


* Call or write your state Senator and Representative and ask them to support the Safe Communities Act: [S.1401](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S1401) (Senator Jamie Eldridge) and [H.3573](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H3573) (Representatives Ruth Balser and Liz Miranda). Get more involved through the [Massachusetts Safe Communities and Coalition](https://www.facebook.com/safecommunitiesma/).


* Encourage our legislature to pass a "driver’s licenses for all" law.  Learn more about [Driving Families Forward](https://www.facebook.com/DrivingFamiliesForward).  Support the Work and Mobility Act and sign the petition [HERE](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/dff-petition).  Attend the Driving Families Forward Lobby Day on July 30 from 11a-12:30p, House Members Lounge, MA State House. RSVP to crisayda@field-first.com.


* Donate [HERE](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-the-massachusetts-tps-committee?source=facebook&) to help TPS holders travel to Pasadena, CA to stand in support as the court cast Nielsen vs Ramos decision influences their family’s future.

* TPS holders’ children have created a play explaining how this administration’s cruelty has affected them.  Watch it [HERE](http://guide.bnntv.org:8000/CablecastPublicSite/show/93888?channel=2).
