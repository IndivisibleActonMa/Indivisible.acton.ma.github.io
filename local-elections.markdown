## Town Elections

### Acton

[Here is information on how to vote](https://www.acton-ma.gov/598/Elections-Voting){:target="_blank"}.

You can download/print the application here: [https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/2021-Vote-by-Mail-Application.pdf](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/2021-Vote-by-Mail-Application.pdf){:target="_blank"}

Your completed application for a ballot can be returned in multiple ways:
 
* Mail or hand deliver: Town Clerk, 472 Main Street, Acton, MA 01720
* Fax (application only – no ballots): 978-929-6340 (your signature must be visible)
* Email (application only – no ballots): clerk@acton-ma.gov (your signature must be visible)
 
FYI - *Even if you received a mail-in ballot in 2020, you need to apply again for the new year*. The Town Clerk will receive the ballots about 30 days before the election and will start sending them out at that time.
 
*Please note that early in-person voting is not available for the Acton Annual Town Election – early voting must be done by Absentee/Vote by Mail ballot. Completed ballots can be mailed or put in the drop box at Acton Town Hall (completed ballots cannot be faxed or emailed).*
