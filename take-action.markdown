**Start a Climate Conversation**

“*Solving climate change requires us all to work together. We can’t do that without finding common ground with those who may not share our perspective.*”  —David Suzuki Foundation

[Pollution made COVID-19 worse. Now, lockdowns are clearing the air.  Will today's cleaner air inspire us to do better?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/pollution-made-the-pandemic-worse-but-lockdowns-clean-the-sky/#close){:target="_blank"}  What do you think??

This month, try discussing the climate crisis with family, friends, or even strangers. It’s super important that we get as many people on our side as possible, especially voters! *As 2020 unfolds, let’s make climate change the number one issue for voters across Massachusetts.*

### Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico has been hit with a devastating series of earthquakes and at least 120 aftershocks. As a result, almost the entire island has lost power. Meanwhile, the HUD continues to withhold hurricane relief funds from Puerto Rico (a territory of the United States), ignoring a statutory deadline to issue a Federal Register notice permitting Puerto Rico to use $8.2 billion in disaster relief aid appropriated by Congress.  And as Rep. Darren Soto pointed out in a press release, “*Puerto Ricans continue to suffer from major hurricanes that made landfall more than two years ago while HUD illegally withholds this aid.*”

This is awful and needs to be called out.

Let's ask the Inspector General of HUD, Rae Davis, to investigate the agency’s failure to process Congressionally approved funds in a timely manner. (202) 708-0430.
