* Let's call Mitch McConnell at (202) 224-2541 and tell him that last week's mass shooting lies squarely at his feet. He needs to pass [HR 8](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8/text){:target="_blank"} and Red Flag laws now. You can also fill out [this form](https://act.everytown.org/sign/smarter-gun-laws/){:target="_blank"} from [Everytown.org](https://everytown.org/){:target="_blank"} which will send a message to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and your U.S. Senators to pass background checks and a strong red flag law that will help prevent further gun violence tragedies.

* Call your Members of Congress and explain that you object to imposing asylum application fees on people fleeing persecution and danger. Not only is this amoral and inhumane, the American Immigration Lawyers Association says the president’s plan “contradicts international law” and still “fails to ensure orderly processing.” Ask your MOCs are doing to stop the president’s asylum fee and instead heal the root causes of life-threatening conditions in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador?
