*"Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble."*

**Advocate for Peace in Yemen**

According to the UN, the conflict in Yemen has become the worst humanitarian crisis in the world these past 6 years. This is due to Saudi-led coalition airstrikes conducted with American support, which was greatly expanded under the Trump administration.  

We are asking Representative Trahan (MA-CD3) who is a member of the Armed Services Committee to strongly and publicly advocate for ending the violence and ending US participation in the Saudi-led coalition’s war on Yemen via a new Yemen War Powers Resolution and work to make sure Biden signs it.

The time to act is now.  

[Please sign the Letter to Rep. Trahan on Yemen](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjeUS0h9AKq5521C5bkuWcVyndMg0GFUmIbdn8dt18i1sCvQ/viewform){:target="_blank"}.
