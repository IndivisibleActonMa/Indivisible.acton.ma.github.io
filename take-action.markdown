* Click [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTMqS6yDQZAGNdad1FYd6cMwj0EoEzDvkqgVPN0GzKX9UpMEaH1U9QmAhTwB-JOiw8MruJaYHj0VNf9/pub) to learn how you can contribute time and/or money to organizations which support immigrant justice.

### Local/State

* Email your MA state legislators and **demand that they lead on immigrant rights and equity**. MIRA (MA Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition) has put together a [comprehensive list](https://mailchi.mp/miracoalition/action-alert-lets-build-momentum-for-our-2019-priority-bills?e=baa65bb0e1&link_id=16&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e) of all of the bills that support immigration and refugee rights and has made it super easy to [email your legislators to support these bills](https://p2a.co/96apnIc?link_id=17&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e).


* **Defend women's reproductive rights!**  Please contact your MA State Senators and ask them to support [S.1209](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/SD109).  Click [HERE](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-advocacy-fund-massachusetts-inc/issues/roe-act/roe-act-cosponsors) for more info.


* On Wednesday, Apr 10, House lawmakers  overrode Governor Baker's veto of a [bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H3594) repealing a welfare benefit cap that restricts the amount of assistance provided to families that have additional children when they are already receiving aid. An override vote is planned for April 25 in the Senate, which approved the bill on a 37-1 vote in late March.  **Thank your representative, and encourage your state senator to vote to override.**.

  *Find your legislators [HERE](https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator)*.


* Let's thank Governor Baker for signing the bill which bars health care providers from conducting or promoting "sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts with a patient who is less than 18 years of age."  You can email him [HERE](https://www.mass.gov/forms/email-the-governors-office) or call his Boston office  (617) 725-4005.

### National

* Call your Democratic MoC today and tell them: **vote “yes” on an addendum to the House Rules for the 116th Congress to establish the Select Committee For A Green New Deal**. If they are already supporting the Green New Deal, thank them. Click [here](https://act.indivisible.org/call/green-new-deal/?link_id=21&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e) to be connected.


* **Call 855-751-5024 and tell your representative to cosponsor Medicare for All**. In just a few short weeks, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal will be introducing a Medicare for All bill in the House of Representatives. This year the House has the best chance in our nation's history of passing Medicare for All. The number of original co-sponsors will determine how seriously Medicare for All is taken by Congress, the media, and the public, so we need to get to work now.  If your representative is **Lori Trahan** email her [here](https://trahan.house.gov/contact/) and say how you hope she will support this progressive plan that a majority of the public supports.


* We've been asking our MoC to **investigate the separation of immigrant families** at the border, along with their subsequent treatment in shelters, and members of the House [have listened](http://sandhillsexpress.com/abc_politics/house-democrats-plan-oversight-hearings-introduce-special-counsel-protection-bill-abcid36144995/). Unfortunately, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar is [refusing to testify](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/22/health-secretary-testify-seperated-children-1119744) before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Let's contact Secretary Azar and tell him that he should take responsibility and accept Chairman Pallone's request to testify: Phone: 877-696-6775/202-690-7000 Mailing address: Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Ave, SW, DC 20201 E-mail: Secretary@HHS.gov  (H/T Rogan's List)


* Time to put a price on carbon!  Learn more about the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://energyinnovationact.org/how-it-works/).  This bill has bi-partisan support!
