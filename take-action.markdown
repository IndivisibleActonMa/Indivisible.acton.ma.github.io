### Local/State

* **Support Ranked Choice Voting - Take the Ranked Choice Voting Public Hearing Pledge.** We want to make a big impact at the State House when it's time for the Ranked Choice Voting public hearing. Unfortunately, under state law, they only need to give us 3 days notice for the hearing. To mobilize fast, [Voter Choice MA](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/mpss/c/DwE/ni0YAA/t.2rz/_kZsxCUeRUe-S5X2e7jKfQ/h13/eAc2-2B5JiIBe4Rx1zyL0vRFZ-2BCAy5NzuyrMQ4Uat-2FTWSv9St6JZSxWQsg1QARQ9n3kgJ8DWf38uwiC6mfIgGNW-2BQw1jHYaJaqz1nKHYmr862F9vzhSxZK81aZUfHbvwo8NHeDeAznLWTywufkiJg06Gyg-2FuE7Y3QU9CGwbU-2BtCF1DfnmX2Pz7KeDwYRM1J7wyc6-2BwzzpmnPjDsEIi3ZSuws1b31QE62dR7K5kfQNzfG84aqmRc89wA6LkSJS8U7RMJte132fcUM3o-2BxEUWYktwg5h5rjDZPhS1e6LivNM25E6TehZ5WpLHxqCnMD4W8DX5qcGK-2FXXjpV4wmFP34medyY3oY-2FIQdS-2BhD9lcVk6qvT-2BNLAeyTBy1FGWVqRK2tsqWNTIKviNqu3jsCR5Zp6LJw-3D-3D) is now collecting pledges from people to attend the hearing.[ ](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/mpss/c/DwE/ni0YAA/t.2rz/_kZsxCUeRUe-S5X2e7jKfQ/h14/eAc2-2B5JiIBe4Rx1zyL0vRFZ-2BCAy5NzuyrMQ4Uat-2FTWSv9St6JZSxWQsg1QARQ9n3kgJ8DWf38uwiC6mfIgGNW-2BQw1jHYaJaqz1nKHYmr861UXI1A84E5Y1gn6bu9NCQijyW3FZgroCCi5kmCfXd9lNJVM1LBJd-2F2VU-2F-2BsNxlaPs3ux7EZH0alx8gQwiVo4n4ys5gurBlHnQuhB7QJQ7YkOatmWrCkr2juGCeGfR-2FO6MPjR4I06xLzoOpgRV8aJ56eUiLUtnvPFxBkWAAXs9oYgs9EiQO3Gnf66ShdFy3fraxWsrP26vrxjtxAJ-2FHCN6O7Pvvk-2BMpB966fF1PmxI1A3c2bjJbB7wHrUZPQcTJmUvKhE5dtAbRZT6lpzv9qLlU7AWGiwWdI60F6eXBSjjkcA-3D-3D).

They will alert people who have pledged to attend as soon as there's a definite date, time and location for the hearing. At that point, you can change your pledge to an actual RSVP.

* **Contact your state lawmakers about the ROE Act.** Click [HERE](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-advocacy-fund-massachusetts-inc/issues/roe-act/roe-act-cosponsors?fbclid=IwAR3q0MsBefpFWEW9kq8vl7sAzzeRyE0iTAZDauZjxpP9ocIvGDyvEDc_CLQ) to find out where your Representatives stand.

* Email your MA state legislators and **demand that they lead on immigrant rights and equity**. MIRA (MA Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition) has put together a [comprehensive list](https://mailchi.mp/miracoalition/action-alert-lets-build-momentum-for-our-2019-priority-bills?e=baa65bb0e1&link_id=16&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e) of all of the bills that support immigration and refugee rights and has made it super easy to [email your legislators to support these bills](https://p2a.co/96apnIc?link_id=17&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e).


* **Defend women's reproductive rights!** Please contact your MA State Senators and ask them to support [S.1209](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/SD109).  Click [HERE](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-advocacy-fund-massachusetts-inc/issues/roe-act/roe-act-cosponsors) to see if your senator is a cosponsor of the ROE Act.

  Call your MA Representatives and ask them to support [H.3320](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H3320).  Click [HERE](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-advocacy-fund-massachusetts-inc/issues/roe-act/roe-act-cosponsors#house) to see if your rep has cosponsored the ROE Act.

### National

* Take the [Indivisible Unity Pledge](http://pledge.indivisible.org): The pledge is that no matter our differences in the primary, once Democrats have a nominee, we’ll do everything in our power to get the nominee elected.  Click [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HojK7c7X3WE&link_id=18&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e&source=email-2019-5-7-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter&email_referrer=email_540613&email_subject=2019-5-7-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter) to watch a clip about the Pledge on Rachel Maddow.


* Call your Members of Congress and explain that you object to imposing asylum application fees on people fleeing persecution and danger. Not only is this amoral and inhumane, the American Immigration Lawyers Association says the president’s plan “contradicts international law” and still “fails to ensure orderly processing.” Ask your MOCs are doing to stop the president’s asylum fee and instead heal the root causes of life-threatening conditions in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador? (H/T Americans of Conscience Checklist).  

* **Immigration - Child Separation**:   Over 2,000 migrant children, many of whom were separated from parents or other relatives, are being housed in a detention facility in Homestead, Florida.  Because the facility is considered a privately run “emergency influx facility,” the government is arguing that it is not subject to the provisions in the Flores Act, and as a result, children there are incarcerated for an average of 58 days (the Flores Act limit is 20 days) before being released to a sponsor. Part of the problem is that sponsors who are undocumented are being detained and deported, leaving the children without a place to go. This private for-profit facility is costing taxpayers $750/day, compared to $250/day it costs to detain individuals in government-run facilities. [https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/why-its-time-to-shut-down-homestead-detention-center](https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/why-its-time-to-shut-down-homestead-detention-center). The American Friends Service Committee has been working with other interfaith groups to provide a consistent witness presence at the site, an a [larger action](https://migrantjustice.afsc.org/) is being planned in Homestead for Father’s Day, June 16.  We can help by [donating money](https://www.gofundme.com/witness-tornillo-homestead?fbclid=IwAR18JFq_n9Xa16N6REQqsYk6o6sfI3rooJorD8-xeYgCjeOhNcDb20j5ev0), and telling our MoCs to support(HR 1069/S 397) [Shut Down Child Prison Camps Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1069) and (S388) the [Families Not Facilities Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/388?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S388%22%5D%7D&s=5&r=1).  These bills would assure that all facilities complied with the Flores Act and they would also bar sharing information with ICE that could lead to the detention and deportation of sponsors in the community.  [We can also put pressure on banks that are financing private prisons.](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article230326379.html?fbclid=IwAR13fQmVWSd8Q09dJVNaRxEfdEwjSv1UPoA_9NspW5ZYTHIBuTSy7PLu12w)  (H/T Rogan's List)
