### Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico has been hit with a devastating series of earthquakes and at least 120 aftershocks. As a result, almost the entire island has lost power. Meanwhile, the HUD continues to withhold hurricane relief funds from Puerto Rico (a territory of the United States), ignoring a statutory deadline to issue a Federal Register notice permitting Puerto Rico to use $8.2 billion in disaster relief aid appropriated by Congress.  And as Rep. Darren Soto pointed out in a press release, “*Puerto Ricans continue to suffer from major hurricanes that made landfall more than two years ago while HUD illegally withholds this aid.*”

This is awful and needs to be called out.

Let's ask the Inspector General of HUD, Rae Davis, to investigate the agency’s failure to process Congressionally approved funds in a timely manner. (202) 708-0430.
