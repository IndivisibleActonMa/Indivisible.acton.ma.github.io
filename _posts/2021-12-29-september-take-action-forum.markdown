One year ago militants attacked our Capitol and tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Since then we have been subjected to the *“Big Lie”* that the election was stolen, state legislators have passed one anti-voter bill after another, local election officials have faced death threats, and the potential for future election sabotage has only grown.

Join with Reclaim Our Democracy at various locations to protest the insurrection and plant our collective feet firmly on the ground where democracy in America began. We must not forget what happened -- and we must join with vigils across the country to demand action from our leaders to prevent these attacks on our democracy. The Senate must act to pass legislation immediately to protect our democracy.

Bring sturdy placards (lit by flashlights, clip-on lights, candles or cell phones), vigorous voices, and your friends and neighbors. **We cannot/dare not remain silent.**

You will find some of us in Concord at Monument Square or in downtown Framingham.
