Pennsylvania Together is a statewide coalition of grassroots resistance groups. We are working to elect Democrat Conor Lamb to Congress. The special election on March 13th in southwest Pennsylvania is the next big test of whether the Democrats will retake the House in 2018. We're going to fight with all we've got - and we are so glad you are, too! Here's how you can help:

### 1. Recruit volunteers in the 18th

Want to help recruit more boots on the ground in the 18th? Voice of Westmoreland, a resistance group in rural Washington county, has a community forum scheduled for January 27th to organize volunteers. We are calling registered Democrats in Westmoreland County who are likely to be strong supporters of candidate Conor Lamb to ask them to get involved. 

 Knocking on doors is the single most effective way to increase turn out in the special election.
Phone calls can be made now until January 26th. Read the volunteer recruitment phone bank instructions here. These can be used as a handout if you are phonebanking with a group.

### 2. Call voters in the 18th

Want to speak directly to voters in PA18 to let them know about the special election? Please read our Conor Lamb phone bank instructions. These can be used as a handout if you are phonebanking with a group.

### 3. Send postcards to voters in the 18th

The PA18 special election will be an upcoming campaign for Postcards to Voters. ‪They provide easy step-by-step instructions with addresses. You use your own cards and postage. Get in on the fun by emailing Join@TonyTheDemocrat.org or by texting JOIN to 484-275-2229‬. Throwing a large postcard party and need a longer list of voter addresses?  Email postcards@TonyTheDemocrat.org. 

**Or join us at attend a weekly meetup at Starbucks or Bagels+ in Acton. See our calendar for details**

### 4. Canvas in PA18? Announcing BlueBnB!

Turn PA Blue is committed to flipping seats in Pennsylvania by not limiting ourselves to the gerrymandered boxes that Republicans have put us in. The BlueBnB program is designed to match up hosts in the PA 18th Congressional District and volunteers from other areas to increase our ground game. For information on canvassing in the 18th, please visit the campaign website.

Hosts - live in the PA 18th (or close to the border)

Hosts provide volunteers with a place to stay, a bed and the appropriate accommodations. Although not required, hosts are encouraged to help volunteers with transportation and meals. 

Volunteers - can be from anywhere, but willing to help!

The volunteers are responsible for their own expenses such as food and travel as the hosts will only be providing a warm bed and bathroom facilities.
