1. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published its[ proposed fee schedule](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/politics/asylum-fee-uscis/index.html?link_id=19&can_id=3ff4c15b62073952b0491b5bb6cdb833&source=email-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-1282020&email_referrer=&email_subject=indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-242020){:target="_blank"} in November, revealing[ increases between 55-83%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/13/cost-become-us-citizen-is-going-up-percent/?link_id=20&can_id=3ff4c15b62073952b0491b5bb6cdb833&source=email-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-1282020&email_referrer=&email_subject=indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-242020){:target="_blank"} on existing fees for citizenship services, as well as a new[ fee to seek asylum](https://cliniclegal.org/resources/federal-administrative-advocacy/faqs-regarding-uscis-proposed-fee-schedule-and-changes?link_id=21&can_id=3ff4c15b62073952b0491b5bb6cdb833&source=email-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-1282020&email_referrer=&email_subject=indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-242020){:target="_blank"} in the U.S.

2. The administration seeks to[ divert over $200 million](https://www.rollcall.com/news/trump-wants-reprogram-dhs-money-ice-detention-operations?link_id=22&can_id=3ff4c15b62073952b0491b5bb6cdb833&source=email-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-1282020&email_referrer=&email_subject=indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter-242020){:target="_blank"} of USCIS and other DHS funding to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

3. In recent years, USCIS case processing has slowed dramatically, due in significant part to the agency’s own inefficient policies. These fee hikes would charge aspiring Americans more money for continually declining service.

4. Individuals currently protected by DACA would face even greater uncertainty as funding for their program is reallocated and renewal fees for protected status multiply.

5. The proposed asylum fee would place a major burden on those who have already suffered tremendous hardship to reach our country, and directly contradicts our moral and constitutional obligation to provide sanctuary to those seeking it.
