Indivisible Acton is supporting Democrats in the **November Virginia Elections** through texting all delegates and calling for two assigned delegates. 

These are the elections for Governor, Attorney General and the House of Delegates.  The Sister District Project (SDP) has assigned Indivisible Acton two Delegates to support: [John Bell](http://www.johnbellfordelegate.com/) (87th district) and [Jennifer Foy](https://www.jennifercarrollfoy.org/) (2d district)

The texting effort is being coordinated by Joris: [joris@indivisibleacton.org](mailto:joris@indivisibleacton.org) To take part read the instructions below and a) register as instructed or b) you can use some shared accounts to which Joris can provide you the login info.
