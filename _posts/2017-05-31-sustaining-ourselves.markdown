The biggest challenge that Indivisible as a whole and Indivisible Acton, specifically, face right now is sustainability. How do we “turn a moment into a movement”? How do we resist the regressive agenda now, take back States and Congress in 2018 and the White House in 2020. How do we lead the country, even the world to take on the huge global challenges that threaten our very existence?
Indivisible National has recognized this challenge and provided great information on how to sustain ourselves. Fortunately, there is lots of research on this topic. I have included two links from them: a piece and a Facebook live event that features researchers on the topic.
Sustainability may seem like a huge challenge. But really it is not: it is about building relationships. We are in this together, so we do it together. We want many to broaden the load. We back each other. It is the basis that sustains any community: as long as we have a purpose and people to do it with, we keep it up.
We sustain ourselves by being a local organization.  We can support each other in person. We get back the deepening of existing friendships, the new friends we make, and the joy of joint accomplishment and the strength we give each other when facing joint disappointment. We do things as a group, because we know that we need each other to get through this marathon. 
For example, for the last month and a half I have barely had time to lead this group, due to travel and family obligations. But Monica, Christine Brown, Sue Funk, the Loebs and Linda Vieira have kept the group going. That’s a movement, a wave. It does not stop, because one drop is blocked by a rock. The others spill around and keep the wave going.
We have been amazingly successful. Two solid red state legislature seats have been flipped. Solid red congressional seats are now up for grabs.
