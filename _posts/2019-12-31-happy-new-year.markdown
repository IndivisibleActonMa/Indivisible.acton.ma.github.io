Dear Activist Family,

Here we are on the last day of 2019, and I feel so lucky to have met you all. I honestly could not have made it through the trump years without you. Our hard work has shown real results. Without the Blue Wave of 2018 flipping the House, there would be no impeachment, and the GOP would have had a blank check to wreck even more havoc.

Now we have 44 weeks to finish the job. To take back our country, we must flip the Senate. We must remove Trump. It’s all hands-on deck for the next 308 days. I know it can feel overwhelming, but I promise that working on something you care about, whatever it is, makes a HUGE difference, for your country and yourself. Here is my personal top ten list on taking action.

**10.Donate to A Cause:** From [Fair Fight ](https://fairfight.com){:target="_blank"} to [Dignity in Asylum ](https://www.dignityinasylum.org){:target="_blank"} there are lots of organizations fighting the GOP agenda. What is your passion? Share it with others. *Small donations matter!*

**9.Vote:** Reach out personally to everyone you know, especially people in other states. Ask them to make sure they are [still registered ](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/){:target="_blank"} after all the voter purges.

**8. Postcard:** Have fun with local activists as we write to Democrats in other states. January 4th at Bagels Plus in Acton is the next meet-up!

**7. Connect:** Energize yourself by making a difference! Check out our [calendar](http://www.indivisibleacton.org/calendar.html){:target="_blank"} for events. Come to the [General Meeting on January 13](http://www.indivisibleacton.org/2019/11/12/general-meeting-and-future-plans.html){:target="_blank"}! Lots happening locally because of Rep. Jen Benson's resignation. Find out how we can make the State House more Democratic.

**6. Text-Banking:** This has replaced phone-banking as the easiest way to interact with voters everywhere. Indivisible Acton can teach you how to do it and then you can do it anytime!  

**5. Canvass Locally:** This will be essential for the special election for Rep Benson's seat. Help Ranked Choice Voting cross the finish line. Talk to people about your favorite candidates. Fun and proven to work!  

**3. Donate to a Candidate:** Do you want big money out of politics? Do you want to help democrats get elected in other states? Small donations matter! Adopt a candidate and share why. Check out www.elect535.org and our February General meeting to get ideas. This will be pivotal in flipping the Senate.

**2. Organize:** We need people to help organize and run local events! Indivisible Acton Area has all the materials and social media support set up. What is your passion? Can you help a few hours a week? Join our team!  

**AND THE NUMBER ONE WAY TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY:**

**1. INCLUDE SOMEONE NEW WHEN YOU TAKE ACTION.** Bring a friend, a neighbor, a relative, or someone you just met at an event. It's time to encourage everyone to participate, in whatever cause they care about. *There's a lot to work on. Find your passion, include others and have fun!*  

See you there!  

Yours in Democracy,

Christine Brown, Steering Committee
