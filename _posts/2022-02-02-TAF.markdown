### Let's get energized!!

On the local level - come hear about a project at Acton-Boxborough Regional High school to help Acton get to 100% green electricity, an important step in the push for net-zero emissions!

On the federal level - You know that the midterms are very important, but how do you sift through all the noise and figure out how to take action?

What if you could check one place for targeted analysis, curated donation suggestions, and impactful actions?

Join this month's Take Action Forum to find out how to get fired up and ready to go!
