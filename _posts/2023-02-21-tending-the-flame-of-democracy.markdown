As Heather Cox Richardson writes in her [July 21 Letters from an American](https://open.substack.com/pub/heathercoxrichardson/p/july-21-2023-friday?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web){:target="_blank"}: 

*"Democracy is based on the rule of law. Undermining the rule of law destroys the central feature of democracy and replaces that system of government with something else."*  

**There is no time to waste. We need to commit to #democracy, now more than ever. [WE NEED TO SHOW UP NOW](https://turnpurple2blue.org/2023/06/26/doing-the-work/){:target="_blank"}.**

As our newsletter Editor-in-Chief Christine writes, **"Before we start the Massachusetts Legislature's two year cycle to pass bills, the rules are voted on.  You've seen how essential McCarthy's rules have been to disrupt democracy in the US House, and Beacon Hill is no different."**

**Thank you for your letters and phone calls!** Last Wednesday, Margaret Scarsdale was sworn in as the duly elected representative to the 1st Middlesex after the unanimous committee report was adopted by the House. This means that her district, without representation since last February, will now have a voice, including being able to file legislation.

**The same is not true for Kristin Kassner of 2nd Essex. Remember that Mariano swore in the losing Republican in her place. We cannot allow this to stand. The newly redistricted 2nd Essex elected her, and her recount was certified by Sec. Galvin and the Governor's Council. It will only embolden the GOP if we allow Blue Massachusetts to be an example of election denialism.**

**Write a Letter To The Editor**

Massachusetts House Speaker Ronald Mariano dealt a serious blow to the democratic process in the Commonwealth when he decided to form a [Special Committee to Examine the Returns](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/01/03/metro/mass-house-leaders-say-theyll-delay-swearing-two-democrats-review-legal-issues-raised-by-gop-opponents/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) in the victories of state Representatives-elect Kristen Kassner and Margaret Scarsdale ([“Mariano’s move in 2 close races roils Democrats,”](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/01/11/metro/no-election-is-safe-amid-rise-election-deniers-house-decision-delay-democrats-swearing-in-touches-nerve-party/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link){:target="_blank"} Page A1, Jan. 12).

Mariano and other House leadership would be well advised to heed the defense by the towns of Ipswich, Georgetown, and Rowley and Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin in the case brought by Republican incumbent Lenny Mirra to overturn Democrat Kassner’s one-vote victory — a challenge that has already been rejected by the trial and appellate courts.

The Massachusetts Constitution grants the House of Representatives the role of being “the judge of the returns, elections, and qualifications of its own members,” and the House should exercise its discretion to uphold the results yielded by longstanding, settled electoral processes. A proper election was held and careful recounts were taken under the watchful eyes of town officials, lawyers, and volunteers, with the advice and input of the relevant state official. Arguments were made and heard and decisions objectively rendered. What is left for the House special committee to do?

True leadership by the House would be to honor what has already taken place and decline to provide the two losing candidates in question a third bite at the apple.

The Massachusetts Legislature made the national news last week, and not in a good way. MA House Speaker Mariano (D-3rd Norfolk) refused to swear in two duly elected Democratic representatives. Marc Elias, our nation's premiere voting and elections lawyer, took time out from Arizona lawsuits to call Mariano's decision "[odd and unprecedented](https://url1005.email.actionnetwork.org/ss/c/CMxF4nARlf6wAFa1PSfv0pxLN8zuXd485gHNRhmg2sYw43yClpkMs5eWxZIdyLSbAro56jUnh-Hij8sYdXKncSpTvm5BMGco3SftIxQE2EQTJ9Eq9MDw_IJjwWhVLElDWTQoPg-JwcFJFjcHjo50OMRTude5P9PqBmshZyVjGGjtcEXQT0eacoM3kHGZxMij82wgCcqdNGOM0n7wnrUqKJRFLCKhjr17nDxG0lRjnflLOzGx7LtGpqyQYXq59G64Sc1SqE3VmRpBusW8x35ddMpyZ2pqD2hP9SlXco-HjlYZ5NstTOBZ_9d7S9mZpTD0VRQYYIfL3ZG2RL97ZOxrBxp4cEtu0Dbn8oiJh6H97dCOCZw51wF4Jr3MneMZnGGba2PUTl_pPDBs11vbatZS6Q/3sq/1IGUSOXBRSag293M1MBGpQ/h0/l13FHzawNwhb0UEwhEwYjKIhFNQlQeYm9WTDsw_QCCQ){:target="_blank"}" Both elections went to a recount, and Secretary Galvin has certified their wins. Republicans are filing lawsuit as fast as they can be dismissed.

**Mariano's actions do not bode well for our democratic values. In a year where we hope to strengthen and protect democracy, he has chosen to take the side of election deniers.**

**A New Year's Letter from the Indivisible Acton Area Steering Committee**

---

Dear Indivisibles,

It's New Year's Eve, and so only natural to reflect on the past year. So much happened, it's hard to believe that it was all contained in only the last twelve months.

What we would like to say is, **thank you**. *Your efforts, big and small, made the difference this year.* From Margaret Scarsdale winning by 11 votes to flip a red district here in Massachusetts, to our history-defying win of the Senate, to our crucial wins of prodemocracy leaders in Arizona, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Pennsylvania; *it was the actions that you took that made the difference*. **And so our flame of democracy endures.**

The last six years have taught us an important lesson. *That flame does not endure without us to tend it. It does not endure without us to fight for it. It does not grow without us to stand up against hate, indifference and injustice.*

The last few weeks we've rested, feasted, and reconnected with friends and family far and wide.  Now it's time to think about our goals for 2023, and my heart is full, knowing that you will include activism, here and across our nation.

The newsletter will be back weekly with opportunities - we'll be watching for special elections and other ways to bolster our allies in the red states.  Here in Massachusetts, we will take a page from David Pepper's book and work to expand democratic values where ever we can as a counterpoint to the authoritarian forces we fight against.

So let's get started!

Indivisible Acton Area is excited to cosponsor Concord Indivisible's upcoming January 6 Actions:  a candlelight vigil on January 6 and an inspiring program of guest speakers on Jan 7.  Here is the link to [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/jan6hearings/event/546047/?link_id=2&can_id=5b37021dbc0c923fe37b06811eb9fbb5&source=email-tell-gov-elect-healey-to-protect-mature-trees&email_referrer=email_1776384&email_subject=_grow-our-strength-by-tending-the-flame-of-democracy_){:target="_blank"}.

See you there!

Happy New Year,

Indivisible Acton Area Steering Committee
