## Sign the petition: Pass the ROE Act

With abortion access hanging on by a thread, ***Massachusetts must take action***. [Will **you** sign this petition today urging our state’s elected leaders to immediately pass the ROE Act](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/we-need-the-roe-act-now?clear_id=true){:target="_blank"}? **The goal is 10,000 signatures!**  


The ROE Act builds safeguards for young people seeking abortion, ensures that a person facing a fetal diagnosis later in pregnancy can access care without leaving the state, and guarantees all people in Massachusetts are able to access safe and legal abortion care without delays or barriers. With Justice Ginsburg’s passing, we need state policies like the ROE Act that dismantle barriers and protect reproductive freedom more than ever.
