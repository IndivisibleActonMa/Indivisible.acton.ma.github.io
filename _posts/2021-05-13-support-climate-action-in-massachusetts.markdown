To Acton Residents:

On Monday, June 21, Acton will hold its annual Town Meeting. The [Acton Climate Coalition](https://ActonClimateCoalition.org){:target="_blank"} whole-heartedly endorses two related warrant articles to help move Acton toward a clean energy future. 

*Please review the [BuildingWithCleanEnergy.org](http://buildingwithcleanenergy.org/){:target="_blank"} website, which answers many questions about these warrant articles.*   

**Strong support** will be needed to pass these articles, so please attend Town Meeting to vote for them. If you are able to attend and vote for the Building with Clean Energy articles, please fill out the pledge form on the [website](https://buildingwithcleanenergy.org/){:target="_blank"}.

The [Acton Climate Coalition](https://ActonClimateCoalition.org){:target="_blank"} is excited to support this concrete step in lowering Acton's carbon footprint, as one way to participate in the emergency mobilization needed to arrest and reverse climate change.
