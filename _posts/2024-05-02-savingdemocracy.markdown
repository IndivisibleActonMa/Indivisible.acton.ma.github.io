The operating override narrowly passed at Acton's Annual Election —*preliminarily by 33 votes*.

Acton’s next task is to pass the town schoolbudgets, at the **ANNUAL TOWN MEETING on Monday, May 6**.

**Check-in starts at 6:00 PM** in the ABRHS cafeteria. There are 1200 parking spaces on the main campus (high school, junior high, Parker Damon, lower fields/skate park). When parking is full, overflow parking and shuttles are available from the Boardwalk Campus on Spruce/Arlington/Elm in West Acton.

**Need childcare?** FREE Movie Night (and crafts) is available 6:30-9:30 PM for ages 4\+. *Email [bavitale@hotmail.com](mailto:bavitale@hotmail.com) with the number of kids you need childcare for by Friday May 3*. The [Acton Parents Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/actonparents) has a central babysitting thread to connect families with younger children, or kids who are better cared for at home, to other sitters.

**Remember to arrive with plenty of time** to park, get checked in, drop off for childcare, pick up a clicker and find a seat!
