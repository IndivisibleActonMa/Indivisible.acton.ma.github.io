We are excited to get everyone together in person to catch up.  Food, Raffle Prizes and Friends!  

Indivisible Acton Area is providing entrees and beverages (non-alcoholic, beer and wine).   

Please bring a side dish OR dessert to share.  

Rain or shine, there is a covered pavilion! We have the whole pavilion so plenty of room to spread out.
