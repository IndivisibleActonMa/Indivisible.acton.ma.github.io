**A Letter from the Indivisible Acton Area Steering Committee**

---

Dear Indivisibles,

It's New Year's Eve, and so only natural to reflect on the past year. So much happened, it's hard to believe that it was all contained in only the last twelve months.

What we would like to say is, **thank you**. *Your efforts, big and small, made the difference this year.* From Margaret Scarsdale winning by 11 votes to flip a red district here in Massachusetts, to our history-defying win of the Senate, to our crucial wins of prodemocracy leaders in Arizona, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Pennsylvania; *it was the actions that you took that made the difference*. **And so our flame of democracy endures.**

The last six years have taught us an important lesson. *That flame does not endure without us to tend it. It does not endure without us to fight for it. It does not grow without us to stand up against hate, indifference and injustice.*

The last few weeks we've rested, feasted, and reconnected with friends and family far and wide.  Now it's time to think about our goals for 2023, and my heart is full, knowing that you will include activism, here and across our nation.

The newsletter will be back weekly with opportunities - we'll be watching for special elections and other ways to bolster our allies in the red states.  Here in Massachusetts, we will take a page from David Pepper's book and work to expand democratic values where ever we can as a counterpoint to the authoritarian forces we fight against.

So let's get started!

Indivisible Acton Area is excited to cosponsor Concord Indivisible's upcoming January 6 Actions:  a candlelight vigil on January 6 and an inspiring program of guest speakers on Jan 7.  Here is the link to [RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/jan6hearings/event/546047/?link_id=2&can_id=5b37021dbc0c923fe37b06811eb9fbb5&source=email-tell-gov-elect-healey-to-protect-mature-trees&email_referrer=email_1776384&email_subject=_grow-our-strength-by-tending-the-flame-of-democracy_){:target="_blank"}.

See you there!

Happy New Year,
