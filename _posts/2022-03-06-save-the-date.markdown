**Tuesday, March 29, 7 PM**

The Next [IMC](https://indivisible-ma.org) Statewide Call co-hosted with [Act On Mass](https://actonmass.org) is a Conversation with Author [David Pepper](http://davidpepper.com)!

Our friends at [Act On Mass](https://actonmass.org) are experts on the MA Statehouse and author [David Pepper](http://davidpepper.com) will explain how the greatest danger to American democracy can be found in statehouses all across the country - not just in the high-profile antics of Marjorie Taylor Greene or Jim Jordan.

Registration required.

Don't miss out!!
