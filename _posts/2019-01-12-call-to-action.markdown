### Call to Action #1

Stop the Trump Shutdown by sharing stories from family, friends and neighbors about their hardships during the government shutdown. Use the hashtag #shutdownstories. Don't use twitter?  Post on our Facebook group and it will be tweeted out.  In either case, also email Monica at monica@indivisibleacton.org your stories of how you or your family is affected by the shutdown as she will be sending them directly to the Chief of Staff for Nancy Pelosi!   Lori Trahan and Nancy Pelosi have asked us to do this to put pressure on McConnell, Republican Senators, and the administration.


### Call to Action #2

Contact Lori Trahan's office to let her know how you feel about funding the border wall. To understand more her thoughts on the issue, read this [Boston Herald article](https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/01/07/chabot-lori-trahan-open-to-border-wall-talks/) which includes an interview with Trahan.  Email Trahan's local office at *meaghan.gallagher2@mail.house.gov* with your opinion.
