### Joint Rule 10 Day

From our friends at [Progressive Mass](https://www.progressivemass.com/){:target="_blank"}:  

According to this State House rule, every joint committee (i.e., committee of both the House and Senate) must take action on the bills before them by the **first Wednesday in February**.

That action can be to give the bill a favorable report (It advances!), to give the bill an adverse report (It's done for the session), to send the bill to study (It's effectively done for the session), or to give the bill an extension (It has more time).

The State House relies on deadlines to spur action, so expect to see a flurry of action on bills later this week.

That also means it's a great time to contact the committees in support of critical bills!

**It is not easy to pass a bill in the MA Legislature. We need your support now. It is very easy!**
