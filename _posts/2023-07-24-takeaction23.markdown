ðŸ“£ **NO NEW WOMENS PRISON**

ðŸ‘‹ It's time to show up again at the State House!  The Judiciary Committee just announced a hearing on the Prison Moratorium and other important bills **Tuesday July 25 at 1pm** and **we need everyone to come and pack the room**!

ðŸ‘‰ **We will be meeting outside the State House at 12:30pm and walking in together.** *Please join us*. The hearing will go on for hours, so if you can't be there earlier we invite you to come later in the afternoon. RSVP Here: [tinyurl.com/FreeHerHearing](tinyurl.com/FreeHerHearing){:target="_blank"}

In addition to pushing for the Jail and Prison Construction Moratorium, we will also be supporting legislation to end life without parole sentencing, eliminate mandatory minimums for drugs, and address other harsh and racist sentencing practices.

The recent Prison Moratorium was HISTORIC - 24 incarcerated people testified. We are so moved by their courage and clear call to create what different looks like here in Massachusetts! **We are fighting RIGHT NOW for incarcerated people to participate in the public hearing because it's essential that the most directly affected people are centered. We cannot go backward to exclusion and repression.** Be sure to come on Tuesday in solidarity with our people behind the wall - and stay ready to mobilize to support them!
