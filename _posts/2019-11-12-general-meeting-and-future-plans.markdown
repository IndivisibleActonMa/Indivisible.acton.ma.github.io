Come hear inspiring speakers and then join us for take action breakouts at our January General Meeting.  

Our featured speakers are from [ACT on MASS](https://actonmass.org){:target="_blank"}. 

Join us to learn about how the Massachusetts State House works and how we can build power for passing our progressive agenda into law. 

We will practice tactical skills on how to effectively engage with your representatives and senators. We will also discuss the recent history of the lack of transparency on Beacon Hill and what us activists can do about it. 

——

Social half hour starts at 6:30pm and the meeting starts at 7pm.

Look forward to seeing you!!
