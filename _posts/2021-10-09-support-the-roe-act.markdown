### November Take Action Forum - Climate Change and Economic Tools for Intervention  

After Manchin derailed a lot of the federal legislation, other ways to intervene have been making the news.  

We are lucky to have a connection to Alex Martin, a Sr. Policy Analyst for Climate Finance at Americans for Financial Reform, who will give a presentation on Economic Tools for Intervention in Climate Change.  It will include:

* Introduction to how climate change affects the economy
* How the SEC can intervene and get more information for investors and the public
* How banks (& the Fed. Res.) can manage climate risk & a safe transition to clean energy
