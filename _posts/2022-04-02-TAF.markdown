### Let's Talk Elections!

Zoom in to hear from our friends at Progressive Mass.

* What are the responsibilities of the Secretary of State?

* What does it mean to be the legal officer of the state?

* What does it mean to the Chief Accountability Officer of the state?

Find out why these elected officials are so important!
