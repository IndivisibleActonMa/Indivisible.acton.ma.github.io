***THANK YOU*** to everyone who has written postcards for the ROE Act! *We have sent out over 10,000 postcards*.  

**Here is what needs to happen next and how you can help make that happen**. 

The ROE Act is in the Joint Judiciary Committee and had a hearing on June 21, 2019. The committee has to take action by the 3rd Wednesday in February 2020 and has 3 options: 

* Vote the bill favorably out of committee so it can be brought to the floor for a vote (this is what we want) 
* Vote the bill unfavorably out of committee or 
* Assign it to another committee, both of which means the bill dies.

### What can we do:

It is too late for a legislator to become a cosponsor so the pressure needs to be on the members of the Judiciary Committee and other legislators to get it voted favorably out of committee. 

Call all members on the Judiciary committee who are cosponsors to ask them to bring the ROE Act for a vote out of committee. (There are 17 legislators on this committee, 12 of which are cosponsors).  

Call your Representative and Senator.  Even if you have already done it, please do it again and ask 5 friends to do the same.  

Have an in-district meeting with your Senator and Representative.  Our Senators and Reps need to know this is a priority and asked why has this bill has not been acted on.  

Call/email all your friends/relatives in other districts especially in Western MA and ask them to call their legislators as well as have an in-district meeting about the ROE Act.
