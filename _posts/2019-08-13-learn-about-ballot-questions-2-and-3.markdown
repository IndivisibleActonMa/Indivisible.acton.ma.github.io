The termination of Temporary Protection Status (TPS) for 320,000 families—including thousands in Massachusetts—is illegal, immoral and would rip communities apart. 

On August 14th, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California will hear Trump’s argument for cancelling TPS for 6 countries. 

Stand in solidarity with our TPS members, friends, family, and co-workers as we fight the right to remain!
