In order to use our time the most efficiently, we as a rule have only one meeting the first Monday of the month. At this meeting we will have one or two speakers, we will conduct some general business and we will break out into issue groups. 

The speakers are important, because they make the meeting more valuable. We will invite people from other organizations to educate us on a particular topic or campaign. An in person presentation and discussion is good for the soul. We can’t only live off what we learn online. 

There may be some general business, like this time we want to spend some money for insurance and we want to talk about the GoG conference. Then there are the issue groups to which we wish to give minimally an hour. Issue groups are welcome to meet on their own, but all so far have chosen to stick to this format, because it saves everyone time and hassle. 

People are obviously welcome to arrange their own meetings. The first Monday meeting is meant to remove the burden of scheduling and holding meetings from people, so that we can focus on effective action and use online communication for coordination.
