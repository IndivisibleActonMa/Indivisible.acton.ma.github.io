We are in the home stretch for the drivers licenses campaign so it's all hands on deck!

[The Work and Family Mobility Act](https://www.aclum.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/work_and_family_mobily_act.pdf){:target="_blank"} would enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard Massachusetts driver’s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements.

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em; color:red">The Work and Family Mobility Act needs to be passed by **TUESDAY, July 21**.</span>

Immigrant leaders from across the state have decided that they will CAMP OUT at the state house Friday-Tuesday to demonstrate just how urgently the community needs drivers licenses.

Here's how you can take action:

* We need 24/7 marshal coverage and lots of food and water donations! Please sign-up to help [HERE](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d4dacae2cabf9c43-encampment){:target="_blank"}.

* Please write to your elected officials and ask them to support the [Work and Family Mobility Act](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2641){:target="_blank"}.  

* Call Senate President [Karen Spilka](https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/KES0){:target="_blank"} and ask her to accelerate the vote. **[Fifteen states, and the District of Columbia, have a similar law](https://www.ncsl.org/research/immigration/states-offering-driver-s-licenses-to-immigrants.aspx)**, including Vermont & Connecticut in New England and New York and California. **This bill will fail if no vote is scheduled by July 31.**
