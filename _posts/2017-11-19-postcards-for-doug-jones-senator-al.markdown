**Democrat Doug Jones** is running for US Senator of Alabama. The special election is Tuesday December 12. **Liberty and Justice for all has been Doug's life's work.**

We will be sending postcards to voters in AL up to 12/5. We hope voters will put our lovely cards on their fridges to remind them to vote. Gathering with kindred spirits to take action is the best medicine against the 45 blues.

We have no more postcard events planned. You have three options:
1. email joris@indivisibleacton.org and ask for addresses. Indicate the amount. A typical start is 25. Joris will send you addresses and instructions.
2. sign up through [https://www.facebook.com/TonyTheDemocrat.org/](https://www.facebook.com/TonyTheDemocrat.org/)
3. email join@tonythedemocrat.org. That's the grass roots group that's running this.

So many teams have signed up that we will likely reach the **every registered progressive** in the state!
