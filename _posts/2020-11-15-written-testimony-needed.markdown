### Action in MA -  FY21 Senate Budget Priority Amendments

Time is of the essence.  We need to get these amendments passed before the session ends.

Please [contact your Senators](https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator){:target="_blank"} by **calling and emailing** them to advocate for the following amendments:

* **180 ROE Act  (Section: EHS), Sponsor: Harriett Chandler**\
  The Commonwealth shall not interfere with a person’s personal decision and ability to prevent, commence, terminate, or continue their own pregnancy consistent with this chapter.  The Commonwealth shall not restrict the use of medically appropriate methods of abortion or the manner in which medically appropriate abortion is provided.  **DONE!**  ✅

* **326 Keeping Families Connected (Section EPS), Sponsor: Sonia Chang Diaz**
  Telephone and video services shall be provided to prisoners in department of correction facilities and county houses of correction at no cost to the prisoners or the receiving parties.

* **336 Ensure Housing Protections During COVID (Section ECO) Sponsor: Brendan Crighton**\
  From the passage of this act until 45 days after the termination of the COVID-19 emergency, there shall be a task force on the COVID-19 eviction diversion initiative. The task force shall track the initiative’s outcomes and make recommendations on how to improve its effectiveness, efficiency and reach.

* **360 Emergency Paid Sick time ((Section ECO) Sponsor: Jason Lewis**\
  There shall be established a fund to be known as the COVID Emergency Paid Sick Leave Fund to be administered by the executive office of labor and workforce development. The purpose of the Fund shall be for financial assistance to businesses not covered by the Family First Coronavirus Response Act for extended emergency paid sick leave.

### Police Reform

The police reform bill has stalled.  Our legislatures promised for meaningful policing reform legislation.

**Please write to your legislators and Governor Baker to support the strongest bill possible:**\

### Emergency Paid Sick Time

Low-wage workers are our first line of defense against COVID-19, but they are feeling the greatest economic impact of the outbreak. Healthcare and long-term care workers, janitorial workers, food service workers, child care workers, municipal workers, adjunct faculty, gig workers, and others on the front lines are critical to supporting our communities during the OVID-19 outbreak.

**Please send a thank you message to your State Senator or urge them to get on board with this absolutely essential legislation:**

### Climate Action

We must push our MA Legislature to advocate for strong and effective legislation during their committee discussions of the climate bill.

See a comparison of the two bills [HERE](http://climateactionnowma.org/wp-content/uploads/ClimateBillsComparisonAug2020.pdf){:target="_blank"} and write to your Representative, Senator and encourage them to write to the Conference Committee to enact stronger climate legislation in Massachusetts - or thank them if they have already done so!

### Driving Families Forward

Doesn't it make sense to enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard state driver’s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements?  It has been endorsed by over 230 organizations, including the Mass. Major City Chiefs of Police, as well as dozens of businesses.
