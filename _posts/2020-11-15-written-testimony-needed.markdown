### Action in MA -  Contact our legislators, Governor Baker

Time is of the essence.

### Transparency is Power

Legislative rules get set at the start of every 2-year legislative session. NOW is our chance to change the broken, anti-democratic rules in the State House. Learn more [HERE](https://actonmass.org/the-campaign/).

### Climate Action

This critical bill has once again passed the MA Legislature. Thank you to Speaker Mariano and Senate Leader Spilka for refiling the bill and to the Senators and Representatives who helped pass it (again).

PLEASE [email Governor Baker and urge him to sign the bill this week](https://www.mass.gov/forms/email-the-governors-office){:target="_blank"}. <span style="color:red;">The deadline is February 7.</span>

### Driving Families Forward

Doesn't it make sense to enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard state driver’s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements?  It has been endorsed by over 230 organizations, including the Mass. Major City Chiefs of Police, as well as dozens of businesses.

[Send an email](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dff-letter?source=direct_link&){:target="_blank"} to Governor Baker, your Senator and State Rep in support of the passage of the Work and Family Mobility Act.

### ROE Act

* [Thank your lawmakers if they voted to pass this bill and rejected Governor Baker’s anti-choice amendments](https://malegislature.gov/search/findmylegislator){:target="_blank"}.  

### Police Reform
