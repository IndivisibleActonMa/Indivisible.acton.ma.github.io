## Phone Banking for the Georgia Special Election!

The Environmental Voter Project (EVP) is **THE ** way to do right for the environment, voter participation and the GA-06 election. The EVP targets *registered non-voting environmentalists* and encourages them to become active voters, which **really works**. Those voters then *stay* as voters.

EVP uses a predictive dialer to call our targeted voters in the Georgia 6th District, something you can do from anywhere that has a wireless connection. We have a training conference call set June 5 and, if you're interested, please RSVP to peter@environmentalvoter.org.

When: Monday, June 5. 6:00 PM
How Long? 30 Minutes
Call-In Number: (641) 715-0632

NOTE: Because of our particular non-profit status, we can't support particular candidates...but we are certain that everybody we're calling is a super-environmentalist who is very unlikely to vote in a special congressional election (which is why we're mobilizing them).
