Indivisible Acton's General Meeting will be **Monday, April 8 at the Acton Memorial Library, 6:30-8:30 PM**.

Social half hour starts at 6:30pm and the meeting starts at 7pm.

Representatives *Tami Gouveia* and *Jon Hecht* will join us to discuss *Transparency at the Massachusetts State House* - the issues and events that led up to the  [disappointing vote on transparency](https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/01/massachusetts-house-rejects-rules-meant-to-boost-transparency.html) that took place in January, and where we go from here.

Look forward to seeing you!!
