### Welcome

Thank you for taking on an organizer role in Indivisible Acton! Organizers make events happen, which make action which move our state forward and resists the national extremism.

### Tools
In Indivisible Acton, organizers use a number of tools to communicate with each other and the general membership.  

Here are some video tutorials to help you get started.

### Managing events on Facebook
