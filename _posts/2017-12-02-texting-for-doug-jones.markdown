Together in 2017, we’ve resisted the worst part of the Trump agenda. Now, Indivisibles across Alabama are using the power of our movement -- combined with the best new digital tools -- to reach the voters who can elect Doug Jones, a man of principle and action.

Indivisible National has set up a text-banking program where Indivisibles anywhere can help our Alabama groups get out the vote for this important election. Election Day is December 12, which means we have less than two weeks to make a big impact.

[Will you sign up for a volunteer shift to stop Roy Moore and elect Doug Jones before E-Day?](http://act.indivisible.org/go/29609?t=5&akid=7742%2E272935%2EgcLnfU)

Here are the details:

What: Indivisible text-banking from Massachusetts
Where: Anywhere! You just need two spare hours, a comfy chair, and a computer or iPad.
When: **12/2, 12/3, 12/9, 12/10, 12/11, and 12/12**, from 9am to 9pm CT every day
Who: Indivisible groups across the country and volunteers like you!

Indivisibles like you have swept amazing, new, progressive candidates into office from Virginia to Mississippi to Oklahoma to Washington state.  Join us for a text-banking shift and be a part of winning this election for Doug Jones -- and for us.

We can be the difference. [Sign up for a volunteer shift now.](http://act.indivisible.org/go/29609?t=5&akid=7742%2E272935%2EgcLnfU)
