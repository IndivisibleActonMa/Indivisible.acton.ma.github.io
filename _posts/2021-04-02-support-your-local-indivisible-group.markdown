This past year we have co-sponsored:

* Rallies for Voting Rights, Abortion Justice, Climate Action
* Forums on MA legislation
* Monthly Take Action Forums
* twice a week gatherings both in person and on zoom.

We have a new election website: [https://TurnPurple2Blue.org](https://TurnPurple2Blue.org){:target="_blank"}

No amount is too small!!  We have work to do!!
