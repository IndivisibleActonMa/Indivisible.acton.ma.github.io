[Indivisible Acton's General Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9GxuTCYZmSotPPzStLssoH6AjZdbccoMfSlanplVd8/) will be **Monday, May 13 at the Acton Memorial Library, 6:30-8:45 PM**.

Social half hour starts at 6:30pm and the meeting starts at 7pm.

Representative *Jen Benson* is our featured Guest Speaker!  She is going to talk to us about *[H.2810](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H2810), An Act to Promote Green Infrastructure and Reduction of Carbon Emissions*.

**What is H2810? H.2810**: An Act to Promote Green Infrastructure and Reduce Carbon Emissions

\(Rep. Benson)\
This bill would establish a direct carbon price on transportation and home heating fuels to fund significant green municipal investment while providing additional assistance to individuals and employers in the form of rebates.
This bill would:
● Set aside 30% of the proceeds ($400-600 million annually) for a Green Infrastructure Bank to fund local and regional emission-reducing projects. 40% of this money would be targeted specifically for low-income communities, and ensuring that all projects funded by the GIF would meet Fair Labor Standards.
● Return the remaining 70% of the money to individuals and employers in the form of income-based rebates to guard against regressive impacts on low and middle income residents such as delivering rebates twice a year before the heating and cooling season.

Look forward to seeing you!!
