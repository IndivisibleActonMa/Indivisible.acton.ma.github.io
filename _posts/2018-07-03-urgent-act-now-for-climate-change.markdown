If we are going to pass good climate policy in Massachusetts this year, it’s now or never.

Last month, the MA State Senate unanimously passed a fantastic bill that would (among other things) price carbon, divest the pension fund from coal, triple the rate of increase of renewable energy generation within Massachusetts, set binding interim caps for our climate pollution, and codify environmental justice into law. This is the exact type of response a state like Massachusetts needs to offer in the face of extreme weather events - like this heatwave - beginning to batter society - and in the face of the total absence of federal leadership.

Yet the MA State House is now considering their own legislation that is shaping up to be less ambitious. With the legislative session ending July 31st, we have a handful of weeks to motivate action, and we need your help to push them to do what the times demand.

Specifically, we are calling for:

* Tripling the Renewable Portfolio Standard
* Opening up solar to low-income residents
Banning the Pipeline Tax
* Codifying Environmental Justice into law
Setting binding emissions caps for 2030 and 2040.

We really need your help on this. If you’ve ever wanted to make a difference on climate change with a relatively low-investment of your time, this is a great opportunity to step up and act!

Here’s our game plan:

1. **Get our reps to pledge their support.**  Call your representative and ask them to take the [Mass Power Forward policy pledge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bO-T5dVo3LPvL7Z8m1qjaYyJ4hqPZ2gJb1bsEZ4ezko/edit) .  Don’t know who your Rep is? - click [here](http://www.sec.state.ma.us/WhereDoIVoteMA/bal/MyElectionInfo.aspx). Please call now or mark in your calendar when you will call in the next 24 hours. Once you do call, log it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctbnRRqWqCpBtinJsb1QxgFnx4uRoeyY9-v2HRV4kbl3WBQA/viewform)

2. **Flood the State House with phone calls.** We are going to generate multiple call storms over the course of the next month. We need you to contribute to those call waves, so sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-zSFePzDOJH2KHHoYSxxnXyMdKDoUM9pfP15prcvU5c/viewform?edit_requested=true). We will provide everything you need in the exact moment.

3. **Canvass in Leadership Districts to help generate more engagement in key communities like Winthrop and Lowell** (home of the Speaker of the House and the House Energy Committee Chair, respectively). Sign up \[here\]       (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYNSxyJ36HkQxYmybrQkRIRtOlO6ZrhCPOZ8bIj7ISQKZRnQ/viewform)!\
   I know there’s a lot going on right now, and many things are competing for your attention. But this is probably the most important email I’m going to send this year, so please please do what you can to act on it. This one’s for the future.

Onward!
