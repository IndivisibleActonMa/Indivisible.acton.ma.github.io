* Are your utility bills too high?

* Is your apartment too cold in the winter or too hot in the summer?

* Is your rent too high?

* Are you concerned about the environment?

The Acton Climate Coalition and Acton Housing For All are hosting a gathering on Saturday, July 17 from 3-5pm at the NARA Park Bath House Pavilion.

Make your voice heard as we work together to find ways that renters can save energy, reduce utility bills and protect the environment.

Don’t miss out! You’ll get free energy-saving light bulbs and the chance to win door prizes. Interpretation, children’s activities and accommodations for accessibility will be provided.

Need a ride? Let us know on the registration form, and we’ll send a free accessible van to pick you up.

Sign up today! To register, fill out the form at [tinyurl.com/actonrenters](tinyurl.com/actonrenters){:target="_blank"} or call or text 978-393-1090.
