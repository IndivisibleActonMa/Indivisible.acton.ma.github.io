March for our Lives: we all are going to go, but where: Chelmsford or Boston? Here are some considerations to help you decide.

## Boston
If you have never been to a huge march, like the 2017 Women’s, Science or Climate Marches, then go to Boston. These huge marches do not come often. It is life-changing to experience the energy and enthusiasm of tens likely hundreds of thousands of people gathered and chanting to support a cause and our democracy. You realize that you are not alone. There are people who will support you if you lead and leaders will rise that you can support. Your vote counts, because it is supported by all the others.

Boston will be huge, probably bigger than Women’s March 2017. I suspect that every person that attended the Women’s March will be there as well as their spouses and tens of thousands students and their families.

## Chelmsford
If you already have been to a big march, then consider Chelmsford, because 

***One thousand people marching in Chelmsford will have more political impact than the same one thousand marching in Boston.***

And of course: you can bring your young family, you can sit down if you need to, and you are in and out in a couple of hours.

A small march builds community engagement: we will all meet neighbors we know at the march and get to know new ones. These clusters of connections all over country taking action at the same time generates the energy and momentum to bring the change that we all seek 

The organizers selected Chelmsford, because to win on the gun violence issue locally and nationally, we need to empower the suburbs. The recent national special elections in PA and AL were won in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Birmingham and Montgomery. Turnout and enthusiasm were huge there. Similarly, to get Democrats elected in MA is easy, but to get our policies enacted is not. To get those policies we need the suburbs. Half the country lives there. 

For all of you living around Chelmsford: Lowell, Acton, Concord, Carlisle, Tyngsborough, Billerica, etc: the march is a path to a coalition to get our priority legislation passed. Our municipalities share state reps and senators with Chelmsford. By showing strength there, our legislators will realize it exists in all our towns: they will respond and/or we will inspire others to run against them.

What works in Chelmsford will rub off onto other suburban towns. Success in Chelmsford will make the news and inspire people in other mixed towns to stand up. Chelmsford is a typical suburb: it is purple that is mixed right and left. It has no Indivisible or Progressive MA chapter. The march in Chelmsford will inspire the activists to come out and discover each other. Being a march organizer I see first hand the excitement building among the Chelmsford towns people, its high school students, and even its police, as they notice that their town is taking a strong and public national stand. It is making them proud and excited.

Finally, the march will be plain fun. You will be inspired by the courage and strength of the local speakers, who are your neighbors: kids and adults. I went to the Ayer Women’s March and saw at least 20 people that I knew. I was moved to tears by the five local women, who did such great work. And I made new friends. New people who now are in our coalition.
