It is important to sign up, so that school officials know what to expect. It will make all of this smoother. It looks like teachers, school board members and students are going to take part.

### Walkout Instructions
It is official, we are on the map for the National School Walkout. Here is the link: https://actionnetwork.org/events/abrhs-walkout

You can RSVP through there however, it is not necessary, unless a person you know who wants to join does not have a facebook. As the event gets closer Mackenzie Cooper and I will be posting more info about what to bring, what to expect and what to do. You can expect to see this info on this page and on the website page.

Right now there are 2 things we all need to do.

1) Get everyone involved, other students, teachers, administrators, parents, etc.
2) Make posters, we need posters for the halls as well as for the actual walk out. The hall posters should have basic event info. Walkout posters can express what you want except must stick to the issue of gun control and regulations. And for the sake of having the admins support please no obsenities. (Some specifics can include but not limit to: 
+Ban Assault Weapons Ban and High Capacity Magazines
+ Expand Background Checks to All Gun Sales
+ Pass Federal Gun Violence Restraining Order Law
+ Fund government research on gun violence
+ Promote Safe Storage)

Any questions you can contact Mackenzie Cooper or Rachel Pryke but everything is quite basic.
