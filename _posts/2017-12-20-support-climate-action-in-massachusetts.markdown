## THE LATEST CLIMATE ACTION PUSH - IT’S CARBON PRICING WEEK!!                

Welcome to the MA Campaign for a Clean Energy Future’s Spring Forward Week of Action!  For the week of April 30th - May 6th we’re working to mobilize in every corner of the state with a 3 fold plan of action:

1. Send postcards to Governor Baker urging his support for carbon pricing

2. Call and write House members urging support for movement THIS session (see below for names and contact info)

3. Submit letters to the editor to highlight the urgency of carbon pricing NOW

[We’ve attached the toolkit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilWYjBSjeGmgSiUrW9b_a-AArYLtzS8b) that includes sample invites, messages, and letters to make this as simple as possible for our coalition members to speak out.

Grassroots leaders across the state are scheduling house parties and public events to get lots of people involved -- let us know if you have any questions about events in your area or if you’d like to host an event yourself. And share updates about your events as well so we can track progress.
