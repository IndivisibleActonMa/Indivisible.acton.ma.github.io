## Premeeting

On 12/11/2017 we had two visitors from the Elder Climate Action, who presented an overview of Climate Change legislation in MA. 

The state has a strong law on the books, the GWSA (Global Warming Solutions Act) which was enacted in 2008 and mandates an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions state wide by 2050.  This is a tough law and we need to meet the goal to avoid the wost effects of climate change.  But we have no plan to get there and we need one ASAP!

This is where the GWSIA (Global Warming Solutions Implementation Act - H.2149/S.479) comes in.  The GWSIA requires the state to model our entire energy economy to identify technically and economically feasible pathways for achieving "deep decarbonization" in Massachusetts.  This is just common sense.  We need a sound plan across all sectors that leverages and coordinates the work needed to achieve this enormously challenging but absolutely necessary goal.  Our legislators are justifiably confused by the jumble of pending energy legislation.  They and we need a roadmap forward.
