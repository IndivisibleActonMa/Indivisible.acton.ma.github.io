### UPDATE

May 12 was the deadline for the Judiciary Committee to report out the ROE Act.  *The ROE Act Coalition has learned that the Judiciary Committee has filed to extend both the House and Senate bills to July 31!*

The Coalition believes the extension will be approved by the House and Senate. Our liaison to the Coalition, Linda Vieira, will keep us posted.  

**ALSO**, the Supreme Court of the United States is expected to release an opinion soon on [June Medical Services v. Russo](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/june-medical-services-llc-v-russo/){:target="_blank"}, a decision that will impact abortion access for millions of people and could decide the future of abortion rights. The decision is expected to be released at any point between now and the end of June.

We don’t know exactly when it will happen, but we do want to be as prepared as we can to launch a coordinated response. We believe the national spotlight on abortion created by this decision will be an important opportunity to highlight the urgency with which Massachusetts must move forward as so many forces are pushing us back in time.

**On the day the decision is released, the ROE Act Coalition will let Linda know and set up an emergency call.** They will aim to have that call within the subsequent 24 hours, so we can debrief the decision, share messaging, and discuss an action plan.

Here are possible responses that we may be asked to take:

* **Immediate Digital Action** - We will supply you with sample social media posts as well as graphics.

* **Engagement in Collaborative Press Activities**

* **Some sort of mobilization ask** - Depending on the timing of the decision, the status of the ROE Act and the legislature’s progress in addressing COVID-related emergency needs, there are several actions we may be asking people to take, ranging from a petition to legislative contact. This ask will not be final until the Supreme Court decision is released.

**If you can commit to participating in rapid response to the decision in June Medical Services v. Russo, please let us know by emailing Olivia at [osantoro@aclum.org](mailto:osantoro@aclum.or) or contact [Lindapiano4593@gmail.com](mailto:Lindapiano4593@gmail.com).**  

There is a Coalition meeting on Wednesday, May 20, 11a-12:30p.  Linda will participate as Indivisible Acton’s liaison. If you would like to participate, contact [Lindapiano4593@gmail.com](mailto:Lindapiano4593@gmail.com).
