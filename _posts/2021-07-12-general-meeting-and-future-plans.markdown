### Activist Appreciation Summer Social 

We are excited to get everyone together in person to catch up. Food, Raffle Prizes and Friends!

Indivisible Acton Area is providing entrées and beverages (non-alcoholic, beer and wine).

* Please bring a side dish OR dessert to share.

*  Rain or shine! There is a covered pavilion! We have the whole pavilion so plenty of room to spread out.

* Please wear a mask if you are not vaccinated.

*Please note* - the June meeting will be starting later than our usual time. Meet and greet will start at 6:45p, and the meeting will start at 7p.
