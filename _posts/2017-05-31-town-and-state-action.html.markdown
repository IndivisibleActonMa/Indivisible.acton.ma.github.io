It is become increasingly clear to me and many others that Indivisible Acton as a group can be most effective by operating in our state and our town. As individuals it makes sense for us to call our Members of Congress, but what we can do that is effective as a group is limited. We can and have supported Special Elections all over the country, but that season is ending.

**National Action:**
There is excellent information on what can do individually to influence what is going on nationally. Notably, Indivisible Somerville puts out a weekly action list that we all can follow: [Somerville](http://bit.ly/2quQ4As). There are many other sites such as [5calls.org](http://5calls.org) and Daily Action.

There does not seem to be that much we can do nationally as a group. From time to time, we can hold or arrange a car pool to a Town Hall with one our Members of Congress. We can support their reelection campaigns in 2018. But it does not seem to make much sense to demonstrate outside their offices on a regular basis as Indivisible Groups in Red Districts and States do.

**State Action:**
Massachusetts is a progressive state. Other states look to us to take the lead. If a measure passes in Mass it can pass elsewhere. It is our Attorney General that is the greatest thorn in 45’s side. 

Massachusetts is not as progressive as it could be or as some other states. We can defend the democracy, environmental, educational and healthcare progress made in this country by expanding it here in MA. See Facebook for the actions that we are taking on the election fairness, environment and health care. 

**Town Action:**
Acton has active groups that are focused on issues that most of us care about. Notably Green Acton and Make Acton a Sanctuary town. We can influence our state by taking action within our town. We are looking for people that could be our liaisons to these groups. Then, when it makes sense, those groups can indicate to us, when to take action. For example, “Make Acton a Sanctuary Town” is targeting a vote at the fall Town Meeting. Green Acton may ask us to come to Board of Selectman’s meeting.
