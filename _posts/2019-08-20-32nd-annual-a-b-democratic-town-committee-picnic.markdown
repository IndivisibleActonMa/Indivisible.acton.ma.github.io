This event is a wonderful time to meet Democratic candidates and elected officials and other active Democrats from nearby towns. 

Please help us support the Acton Boxborough Food Pantry by bringing a non-perishable food item to the picnic.  

There is large variety of food, so no need to bring your own.  

Please note the suggested $10 contribution per person or $20 per family.   

For questions or to RSVP, please contact Ellen Valade at ellenvalade@yahoo.com.
