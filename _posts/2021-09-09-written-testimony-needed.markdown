### Support Anti-racist Education Bill

We are so happy to endorse [Coalition for Anti-Racism, Equity, and Justice in Education](https://www.care4eduequity.org/){:target="_blank}. Although the bill was favorably reported out of the Joint Committee on Education as an attachment to the Educator Diversity bill, the attachment was made without any accompanying language. *Stay tuned for future action!*

### Driving Families Forward

*UPDATE:* The House passed [H.4461, The Work & Family Mobility Act](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H4461){:target="_blank"}, driving us one step closer to ensuring safe and secure roads for everyone in our Commonwealth. The bill is onto the Senate!

Doesn't it make sense to enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard state driverâ€™s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements?  It has been endorsed by over 230 organizations, including the Mass. Major City Chiefs of Police, as well as dozens of businesses.

[Send an email](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dff-letter?source=direct_link&){:target="_blank"} to Governor Baker, your Senator and State Rep in support of the passage of the Work and Family Mobility Act.
