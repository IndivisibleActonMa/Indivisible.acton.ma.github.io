*“There is sufficient evidence to draw the most fundamental of conclusions: now is the time to declare a state of planetary emergency. The point is not to admit defeat, but to match the risk with the necessary action to protect the global commons for our own future.”*  

Professor Johan Rockstrom, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research
