We are requesting help from members to write to your state representatives to sponsor the AVR bill: H.2091. We are asking that the members write postcards to their state representative/senator in addition to MA House Speaker Robert DeLeo.

1. Send a postcard to Speaker DeLeo with a request to bring the AVR bill to vote! 
2. Send a *Thank You!* postcard to your local representative if he/she is a co-sponsor of the AVR bill.
